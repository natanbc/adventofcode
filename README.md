# Adventofcode

My [AoC](https://adventofcode.com) solutions for 2018.

## Building

Run `mix escript.build`. That's it.

## Running

Create a directory named `input`. Inside it, place the inputs for all days in the format
`Day<day>-<part>.txt`, eg `Day1-1.txt`, `Day1-2.txt`.

After that, run `escript adventofcode` to run all days, or `escript adventofcode <day a> <day b> ...`
to run specific days.
